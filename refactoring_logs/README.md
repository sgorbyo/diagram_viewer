## Key Architectural Decisions

### **Diagrammer-Controller Pattern**
The package evolved from a monolithic BLoC-based architecture to a clean Diagrammer-Controller pattern where:
- **Diagrammer**: Handles rendering, event capture, and transform management
- **Controller**: Manages business logic and diagram-specific behavior

### **Transform2D Migration**
Replaced Matrix4 with custom Transform2D class for:
- Better performance (no 4x4 matrix operations)
- Cleaner API with focal point stability
- Improved testability and maintainability

### **Event System Evolution**
Developed unified PhysicalEvent system that:
- Unifies platform-specific events (mouse, touch, keyboard)
- Enriches events with logical coordinates and hit-test results
- Provides clean separation between event capture and business logic

### **BLoC Architecture Refinement**
Split monolithic BLoCs into focused components:
- **Internal BLoCs**: TransformBloc, ZoomBloc, PanBloc (Diagrammer)
- **External BLoCs**: MainDiagramBloc, EventInterpreter (Controller)

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundations**
- ✅ Core interfaces and contracts
- ✅ Event system design
- ✅ Basic architecture setup

### **Phase 2: Implementation**
- ✅ New DiagramViewer widget
- ✅ Event handling and enrichment
- ✅ Hit-testing engine
- ✅ Rendering pipeline

### **Phase 3: Refinement**
- ✅ BLoC separation
- ✅ Transform2D migration
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Testing improvements

### **Phase 4: Cleanup**
- ✅ Legacy code removal
- ✅ File reorganization
- ✅ Documentation updates

## Lessons Learned

### **Architecture Design**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between rendering and business logic is crucial
- **Event-Driven Design**: Unified event system provides flexibility and extensibility
- **Performance First**: Transform2D migration significantly improved performance

### **Implementation Strategy**
- **Incremental Migration**: Gradual migration allowed for testing and validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility during transition
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing ensured reliability

### **Code Organization**
- **Modular Design**: Focused BLoCs are easier to test and maintain
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts enable extensibility
- **Documentation**: Historical logs help understand design decisions

## Current Status

The package has successfully evolved from a prototype to a production-ready architecture with:
- ✅ Clean Diagrammer-Controller separation
- ✅ High-performance Transform2D system
- ✅ Comprehensive event handling
- ✅ Extensive test coverage
- ✅ Clear documentation

## Next Steps

Future development should focus on:
- **Performance Optimization**: Spatial indexing for large diagrams
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom behaviors
- **Documentation**: User guides and examples
